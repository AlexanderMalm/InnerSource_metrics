    <h2>Metrics Description:</h2>
    
        
            <strong>Documentation Availability:<br></strong> This metric assesses the availability and accessibility of essential project documentation, 
            defined by the quantitative criteria of Engineering Baseline's ADR-EA-10 and the recommended inner source documentation set. The total repository 
            document set evaluated by this metric includes README files, License, Code owners, Contributing guidelines, and Pull_request_template. Additionally, 
            the presence of links leading to further documentation contributes to the total score. Documentation was identified as the metric most strongly 
            correlated with IKEA's inner source goals. The study underscores the importance and significant challenges of documentation in inner source development.

            <strong>GitHub Check failrate on merge:<br></strong> This metric gauges the acceptance of pipeline failures by scrutinizing the rate of failures in automated 
            pipeline testing using GitHub Actions. It is calculated by dividing the number of failed and cancelled jobs by the total number of jobs on merged PRs. A higher 
            failrate might be tolerable within a closed development team familiar with their product's intrinsic features and tests, but an inner source project should aim 
            for a low failure rate. Research into open source development indicates that pipeline testing boosts productivity among both external and core developers. However, 
            an excessively rigorous test suite could deter the merging of external PRs. Therefore, an inner source project should aim for a low failrate while maintaining an 
            effective and transparent test suite.
        
        <br><br>
        
            <strong>Time-to-close:<br></strong> This metric represents the median time from the creation of a PR to its closure, either by merging or simply closing without 
            merging. A high time-to-close metric could indicate potential challenges in development practices or engagement with GitHub processes, or for individual repositories 
            simply not prioritated functionalities. A very low time-to-close could point to extensive use of bots or an inadequate review process. In an inner source context, 
            transparent and efficient review processes are crucial for project success, and deficiencies may deter contributions from outside the team.
        
        <br><br>
        
            <strong>Visibility:<br></strong> This metric quantifies the level of engagement and interaction developers have with a repository, as shown by the number of forks, 
            stars, and watches a repository accumulates. A high number of forks could signal the reusability of the codebase, as it indicates that other teams are repurposing 
            the code for their own projects. Conversely, a high number of stars and watches can denote active interest in and monitoring of the repository's updates and activities, 
            demonstrating an environment of knowledge sharing. A wide range of stakeholders has been proven vital for an inner source project's success. Hence, measures such as coding 
            events, workshops, or other activities to increase project visibility and recognition of its technical solutions are recommended.
